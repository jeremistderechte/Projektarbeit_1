0,"in 2008, hillary clinton was defeated in the dnc primary process by barack obama, a man who at that time was a little known senator from illinois who had not even served out a single full term. in spite of racist attitudes, obama's description of himself as a ""skinny kid with a funny name"" and connections that enabled hillary to become a senator in new york after 8 years as first lady, voters chose a comparative unknown over hillary. in 2016, obama implored voters at the dnc convention to cast their votes for hillary as a way to show their approval for his legacy. at the end of the day, most of the coverage of donald trump on every major network was condemnatory, and fox news (which lost its blue collar base to breitbart) was lukewarm in its coverage of trump at best. the sad fact is that hillary lost for a multitude of reasons in 2016, and most of them have nothing to do with anything other than who she was as a candidate.","hillary clinton, barack obama, obama's, hillary, obama, donald trump, trump","[[9, 24], [68, 80], [224, 231], [320, 327], [429, 436], [515, 522], [800, 807], [447, 452], [625, 630], [764, 769]]"
1,"""the deeper reason putin seduces is that he believes in the principle of power."" i sense that the author has been seduced by the image of putin, an autocrat ruling an ex - superpower country with an inherited arsenal of nuclear weapons. beyond the potential to destroy life on earth, russia is a country with an annual gdp smaller than california's or italy's. it leads the world in exporting oil and gas and other natural resources. russia does not lead in any other significant area, cultural or scientific or technological. my point here is that putin has accomplished less than nothing. he has messed with georgia and ukraine, causing needless deaths and geopolitical sore spots. he has recklessly allowed a russian antiaircraft missile crew to go to eastern ukraine and through their incompetence shoot down a large civilian airliner. now he allows assassinations of russians abroad out of revenge. but let's step back for a minute before we make some asinine disparagement of some leaders of western democracies.strategically, putin has gained what? no territory, besides crimea, which adds a tiny peninsula to an already vast land territory. beyond that he has achieved no lasting accomplishments other than to be a bully and cultivating the image of a rogue state. he has brought sanctions on himself. putin can be a troublesome bully no doubt, but this article impressed upon me that we are prone to underestimate the vast power we have in comparison to russia and our ability to prevail.",putin,"[[19, 24], [138, 143], [549, 554], [1033, 1038], [1310, 1315]]"
