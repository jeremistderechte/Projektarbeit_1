7,"$0.02 from an armchair engineer who reads a lot about failures... having studied the photos and the artist drawings of the completed bridge, it appears that we are looking at a half - bridge. the column by the water (by the green crane) was the center support and future cable tower. the diagonal between the upper and lower deck align with the planned tower cables and end in humps on the top that appear to have connection points on them for the cables. the other half of the bridge was to continue over the water. my amateur guess is that the failure started when the lower deck detached from the center portion. i base this on the photo showing the left end flat on the ground while the other end angles up to the support to which it is still connected along with the way the upper deck at the left appears to have been pulled down by the lower deck. whether that failure had to do with the reported tensioning of unexpectedly loose cables will, i'm sure, be a focus of investigators. a big question requiring an answer is: when you are building a ""first of it's kind"" structure and find, if rubio's reports are correct, that critical components are ""unexpectedly loose"", why wasn't the first step to immediately clear the area and block traffic until the cause was determined and corrected?","{'entities': [(1096, 1103, 'PER_CUSTOM')]}"
